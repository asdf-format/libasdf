 * ---------------

 * integer type that can hold that value.  For example the number ``42`` is
 * typed as `ASDF_VALUE_UINT8`.
 *
 * However, integer up-casting to larger integer types.  Downcasting that would
 * cause an overflow is not allowed.  For example ``42`` can be cast to an
 * ``int16``, but ``-42`` cannot be cast to a ``uint16``.
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *   In practice, unless you know some schema expects a small integer for a
 *   value, you will mostly just want to use `asdf_get_int64`.
 *
 * With the ``asdf_get_(uint)N`` getters the `asdf_value_err_t` return value
 * may also be `ASDF_VALUE_ERR_OVERFLOW` if the value is an integer that is too
 * large to represent in the requested type.
 *
 * Big integers (greater than ``UINT64_MAX`` or less than ``INT64_MAX``) are
 * not supported--in fact the ASDF Standard expressly
 * `forbids <ASDF Numeric Literals>`_ writing them to ASDF files.  Nevertheless
 * it could be supported in the future if the need arises.  In fact,
 * technically the ASDF Standard disallows integers greater than ``INT64_MAX``
