These test outputs can be regenerated by running `./test-info.sh --update` in
tests/ directory.

This simply runs `asdf info` and regenerates the files to known-good outputs.
The current outputs were simply confirmed manually by comparing against output
from the asdf Python library.  Smarter might be to confirm the outputs
automatically against the Python lib, thought he outputs from the Python
`asdftool` and the libasdf `asdf` program are different enough currently that
they cannot be compared directly.
